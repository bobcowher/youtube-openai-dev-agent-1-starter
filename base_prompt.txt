            Please take the attached unit tests and goal, and provide code written in python that will pass the tests. 
            You are being used as part of a fully automated system. The answer you provide will be directly written to a .py file to be executed. 
            Absolutely do not return the python executable or quotes around the code. Just return the raw code.
